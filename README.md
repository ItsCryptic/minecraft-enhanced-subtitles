# Movable Subtitles
In Minecraft update 1.9, subtitles were finally implemented. They are shown in the bottom right corner of the screen and display sound event information, including the direction from which the sound is coming from. However, this position isn't necessarily conveinient for everyone who needs to use the subtitle feature. Not everyone can fully focus on the subtitles in that position while also trying to play the game, so this mod will allow the user to customize the subtitle overlay position.

## How to Install
This mod is in the very early stages of development and is not ready to be installed yet. As it is developed more information regarding installation and contribution will be added to this file and the wiki.
